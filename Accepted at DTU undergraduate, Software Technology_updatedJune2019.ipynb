    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 20px; line-height: 26pt\">Overall there is quite a large number of drop-outs among the students accepted at DTU and the number of females who actually graduate from software technology is *very* low. Taking into account that quite a few students use an extra semester or two on completing their bachelor, fully predicting the exact graduation date cannot be done from this data. Even though the number of graduating females are low, there is in fact an increase in females graduating, let's hope this tendency continues. Within meths the number graduating is markedly higher and the trend seems to stick.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "> <p style=\"font-size: 20px; line-height: 26pt\">Of all the women accepted in software technology until 2016, only half of them have graduated.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 20px; line-height: 26pt\">**From 2004-2018, 26 women have actually graduated with a degree in Computer Science, which means that on average 1.85 women graduate each year.** However from the data it can be seen that the number of women applying for an education within CS is growing. Even with less data on maths the number of women graduating is more than three times higher.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 20px; line-height: 26pt\">The field of AI has been very popular even among women. The number of accepted women after the first year is 20%! One of the reasons for this (I believe) is the fact that the study line is better scoped. Telling someone you want to study software technology seems very vague and will only be something you truly understand if you have worked with it prior to starting your university education or after having studied it a couple of years. This is also one one of the reasons I believe women seem to be less interested. **They don't know what it is about**. This is where AI and Data Science has a large advantage. You have narrowed it down to some specific fields within maths and computer science which makes it more palpable.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size: 20px; line-height: 26pt\">Comparing DTU with other universities the number of women accepted is still low but not the same ratio. The number of women on ITU is generally higher and the number of women on KU is lower but slowly catching up with DTU. The IT University is relatively new and from my experience, and what I have been told from peers, they have a competitive advantage in getting female students as they are seen as mroe modern and have a higher focus on practical learning. Copenhagen University on the other hand is seen as more theoretical and \"hard core\". Sadly as women often tend to have a lower self-esteem they don't go with the more \"hard core\" technical courses but instead focus on the softer values. This is one of the reason why I believe that the number of female students generally is higher at ITU.\n",
